# Sonar vs Metal Prediction Model

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts whether an object detected by sonar is a metal or a rock.

## Overview

This project utilizes logistic regression to create a predictive model. The data used for training and testing the model involves sonar signals bouncing off different objects in the ocean. Python programming language and Google Colab were used for implementing and running the model.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sonar_vs_Metal_Prediction_Model.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to train and test the model.

## Files

- `sonar_vs_metal_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the prediction model.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains sonar signals obtained from bouncing off various objects in the ocean. The task is to classify these signals as either metal or rock.
